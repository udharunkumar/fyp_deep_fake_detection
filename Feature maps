Feature extraction and visualization

Extracting the Feature Map: 
The feature maps (fmap) obtained from the neural network represent the activations of neurons in the last layer of the network.
Each feature map corresponds to a different filter applied to the input image. In this step, the feature map corresponding to the last layer (fmap[-1]) is selected.

Reshaping the Feature Map: The selected feature map is reshaped into a 2D array. 
This reshaping process collapses the spatial dimensions (height and width) of the feature map into a single dimension while preserving the channel dimension.
The resulting shape is (nc, h*w), where nc is the number of channels (or filters) in the feature map, and h and w are the height and width, respectively.

Extracting the Weights of the Final Linear Layer: The weights of the final linear layer (linear1) of the neural network are obtained. 
These weights represent the importance of each neuron in the last layer in making the final prediction.

Calculating the Weighted Sum: The dot product is calculated between the reshaped feature map and the weights of the final linear layer. 
This operation effectively computes a weighted sum of the activations of neurons in the last layer, where the weights are determined by the learned parameters of the final linear layer. 
Each element of the resulting array represents the contribution of a specific neuron to the final prediction.

Result: The resulting array represents the importance of different regions of the input image as determined by the neural network. 
Higher values indicate regions that are more influential in the prediction process, while lower values indicate less influential regions.
This array is further processed and visualized to highlight the regions of the input image that contributed most to the model's prediction.
